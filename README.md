This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon assembly code error involving invalid memory access due to an incorrect address calculation. The error occurs in the instruction `mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx]`, where the calculated address falls outside the bounds of allocated memory.  This results in a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.  The solution provides a corrected version of the code with appropriate bounds checking to prevent the memory access error.
